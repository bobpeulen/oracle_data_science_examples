About 5% of its outlets are located in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe fast food retailer drew criticism after its Israel-based franchise said it had given away thousands of free meals to members of the Israeli military, sparking calls to boycott the brand by those angered by Israel's military response in Gaza.\\n\\nIt prompted franchise owners in Muslim-majority countries such as Kuwait, Malaysia and Pakistan to put out statements distancing themselves from the firm.\\n\\nMr Kempczinski called the backlash 'disheartening and ill-founded,' and blamed it on 'misinformation'.\\n\\nMcDonald's global sales grew by just under 4% in the fourth quarter, down from 8.8% in the previous quarter, and below its annual average.\\n\\nThe corporation benefitted from price inflation, recording its strongest sales growth in the United States, while also growing sales in the UK, Germany and Canada.\\n\\nBut its US business saw weaker sales growth than hoped, as customers on lower incomes ordered less food and opted for cheaper items on the menu.\\n\\nLast week, Starbucks also cut its annual sales forecast, partly due to fewer customers visiting stores in the Middle East.\\n\\nMcDonald's said on Monday that its thoughts were with the families and communities impacted by the conflict in the region.\\n\\nIt said it would 'continue to stay focused on supporting our people and the local communities in which we operate'.\\n\\nMcDonald's hit by Israel-Gaza 'misinformation'\\n\\nStarbucks blames 'misrepresentation' after boycotts\\n\\nUS court rules Trump has no presidential immunity\\n\\nKing Charles seen for first time since cancer diagnosis\\n\\nPrince William can show his own version of royalty\\n\\nTrump's loss in court is a win for his delay strategy\\n\\nHow a grieving mother exposed the truth of Turkeys deadly earthquake\\n\\n'Will you come and get me?' Gaza girl's desperate plea before losing contact\\n\\nWho is really pulling the strings in a divided Pakistan?\\n\\nSenegal on the brink after elections postponed\\n\\nWhat's killing so many of Sri Lanka's iconic elephants?\\n\\nIs Ireland's productivity boom real or 'artificial'?\\n\\nWhy both Trump and Haley may claim victory in Nevada\\n\\nWhere it's taboo if dads don't take parental leave\\n\\nHow one rhino became a global celebrity\\n\\nThe literary scandal that rocked US high society\\n\\nWhen employers gut middle managers, everyone hurts\\n\\n2024 BBC.

Much of the good news had to do with the economy, as the stock market broke records and prices have come under control. The war on inflation is over. We won, Paul Krugman, the Nobel economics laureate, had declared. Donald Trump has been attacking the economys performance since his reluctant departure from office, and so, when he tried to take credit for it last week, it seemed a good gauge of how much the wind is shifting. this is the trump stock market, he wrote on Truth Social, because my polls against biden are so good that investors are projecting that i will win, and that will drive the market up.\\n\\nElection campaigns are competitive enterprises, not just consumer-sentiment thermometers, so the more important developments for Team Biden concern Trump himself (and maybe his comeuppance for other poorly thought-through things hes written on Truth Social). Just three days after he won the New Hampshire primary, a New York jury ordered him to pay eighty-three million dollars for defaming E. Jean Carroll, whom he had previously been found liable for sexually abusing. Criminal trials await, and nearly a quarter of Trump supporters say they wont vote for him if he is convicted. (Reason #50,000,000 Trump Wont Beat Biden: His PAC Spent $50M on Legal Fees, as the Nikki Haley campaign put it.) Trump wasted his victory speech in New Hampshire with a sour rant about Haley, after which she dug in deeper. In his courtroom appearances and in his efforts to persuade the anti-Trump holdouts in the G.O.P. to give up the Haley dream, he now finds himself in environments where his demeanor works against him. So do his supporters, who last week declared war on Taylor Swift.\\n\\nRun the numbers, as the election year begins, and life in this country looks to be getting less bleak, more studded with possibility. In 2022, the U.S. recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic. In the year since, unemployment has stayed below four per cent, and the economy is now performing more strongly than that of every other wealthy nation, including China. Gaps that had seemed permanently wide began to close. The post-pandemic recovery reversed about a quarter of the growth in wage inequality that had taken place in the previous four decades, and the wealth of Black and Hispanic families grew by sixty-one per cent and forty-seven per cent, respectively, between 2019 and 2022, significantly outpacing the thirty-one-per-cent increase for white families. Major, unprecedented bills became lawthe Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Actcommitting the country to an expansive building program, much of it in beleaguered regions, designed to accelerate the green transition. The progress isnt all linearwe are producing an immense amount of gas and oil. But scan the country and you will catch glimpses of what might be an extraordinary transformation. In South Dakota, of all places, eighty-four per cent of in-state electricity is now generated by renewable resources.\\n\\nPoll Americans, though, and the dissatisfaction with the current regime is profound. A few polls have shown Biden ahead of Trump (last week, Quinnipiachad him up fifty per cent to forty-four nationally), but many align with Bloombergs latest, which shows that voters prefer Trump in every swing state and trust him to better handle the economy by a wide margin. Only twenty-nine per cent in the same survey say that the country is on the right track. How can this be? Theories abound. Even if inflation is in retreat, prices for gas, groceries, and rent are still much higher than theyve been in recent memory, and so it may be some time before people believe that the economy is as strong as the numbers indicate. The news has focussed on the flood of migrants at the southern border, and on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, which can suggest instability and unease. And some who think that the country is on the wrong track are liberals, who see in Trumps continued strength, and in the Supreme Courts reversal of reproductive rights, strong evidence that America is still defined by its reactionary turn. The country has been rife with inequality for a long time, and many may doubt that general gains will do much for them. People have earned their cynicism.\\n\\nFor Biden and his campaign staff, the problem is tactical. How can he pull this off? There is no shortage of advice. The easiest path might be to run as Democrats have done successfully in every election after 2016: against Trumps assault on democracy and social values, and against his movements extremism on gender and abortion, which has given Bidens party a huge advantage among women. The strategist Simon Rosenberg advised keeping it simple: Democrats are going to save the country. Republicans are dangerous. He added, Since Trump unveiled himself as maga in the 2017-2018 cycle, we just keep winning elections. We won the 2018 cycle. We won the 2020 cycle. We won in ways that people never thought we would in 2022.\\n\\nThats true, mostly: the Democrats lost the House in 2022, and 2020 was a nail-biter. Joel Benenson, who helped steer both Barack Obamas and Hillary Clintons Presidential bids, recently suggested taking the opposite approach. He said, One thing Mr. Biden should stop talking about: Mr. Trumpadding that the charges Trump faces are, by themselves, cause for alarm among the general public. Elections are about the future rather than the past, he noted, and urged Biden to make this one a forward-looking choice built on a contrast of economic vision and values.\\n\\nYet a funny feature of this campaign is that, since both candidates are unpopular, Biden is hoping (as his aides have told reporters) to let Trump have center stage, so that voters might be reminded how much they despise him. A seeming consequence, though, is that it has left Biden saying how essential this election is, but saying so quietly. His democracy-themed kickoff speech near Valley Forge drew respectful but limited coverage, relative to the spectacle of Trumps feud with Haley. On one level, the choice that Biden faces seems profound: make this election about the nations continuing progress under his Administration, or about the destructive potential of a second Trump term. But he probably needs to do botha little bit about the future, a little bit about the past. That will require turning up the volume.\\n\\nWhat successful entrepreneurs have in common.\\n\\nJulia Child, captured in her husbands shimmering photographs.\\n\\nHow I learned to cycle like a Dutchman.\\n\\nThe long afterlife of a terrible crime.\\n\\nThe case for not being born.\\n\\nShouts & Murmurs: Im Not an Asshole.

This dispute saw New Hampshire's delegates be unseated at the Democratic National Convention, and saw the results of the primary be disallowed for Biden's official nomination.  This opened the door for Rep. Dean Phillips to challenge President Biden, but the New Hampshire Democratic establishment organized a write-in campaign for Biden, which ultimately resulted in his victory.

The state of New Hampshire declined to step aside. To honor his promise, Biden did not enter the New Hampshire primary.\\n\\nThat decision opened an opportunity for Biden detractors inside and outside the Democratic primary process: If the incumbent president refused to compete, somebody else could enter and appear to win. It would not be much of a victory, but it might be misrepresented to look like one. Maybe it could even force Biden out of the race, as President Lyndon B. Johnson was forced out by a rivals strong showing in the New Hampshire primary of 1968.\\n\\nHow hard could it be to win a one-dog dog show?\\n\\nTurns out, harder than it looks. Almost 100,000 people cast ballots in the New Hampshire Democratic primary. Not quite 25,000 chose a Biden alternative. Almost all the rest seem to have written in Bidens name. (The counting still continued as of 9 a.m. ET.)\\n\\nA lot of money has been raised and spent this cycle on the hypothesis that a big internal demand among Democrats exists for an alternative to President Biden. The anti-vaccine celebrity Robert F. Kennedy Jr. entered the Democratic contest in March 2023 (then switched to an independent candidacy in October). The gadfly academic Cornel West, seeking to attract Biden voters in the left wing of the Democratic Party, entered as a Green Party candidate before also switching to run as an independent. In the Democratic primary race proper, the spiritualist Marianne Williamson and Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota have tried their luck.\\n\\nA prospective No Labels ticket now loomspremised on the assumption that millions of centrist Democrats want to join hands with moderate Republicans in equal rejection of both ex-President Trump and President Biden.\\n\\nRead: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.s last gasp\\n\\nThose who promoted a Biden challenge could cite proof points: the presidents soft approval numbers, apparent disaffection among younger and minority voters, the presidents age and alleged infirmity. The challenge-promoters argued that they had the best interests of the party at heart; they wanted a candidate more certain to defeat Trump.\\n\\nYet, when put to the test in New Hampshire, the proposition met a harsh rejection. It was rejected even though Biden did not campaign in the state at all.\\n\\nThat New Hampshire rejection does not necessarily mean the proposition is doomed for all time. Maybe Phillips was the wrong messenger, too obviously driven by ego and pique, too void of a message more powerful than We need an alternative. Im an alternative. Therefore we need me. The No Labels project has not yet named candidates. Perhaps the possibility of a Joe Manchin candidacy for president or vice president could energize dissident Democrats uninspired by Phillips. (Before I joined The Atlantic, I participated on a pro bono basis as a speaker at some No Labels events from 2010 to 2014.)\\n\\nBut maybe the challenge-promoters are also missing something important. Trump has generated a deep personal bond with members of the (shrunken) Republican Party. Biden has not done that. But that is not the nature of the transaction between Biden and his party. Biden typically opens remarks with the phrase Heres the dealand thats exactly what Biden offers: a deal, not a cult.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party is a big, sprawling mess, and has long been that way. In the Trump era, it spans the ideological distance from Bernie Sanders to Cindy McCain. There is no one Democratic base: Jim Clyburns socially conservative voters are part of that base as much as, or more than, Elizabeth Warrens ultra-progressives are. Democratic coalitions are typically assembled by highly targeted benefits rather than mobilized by big messages as Republicans often are: $35 insulin, defense of abortion rights, student-loan forgiveness, environmental measures. The current coalition includes intense supporters and intense critics of the state of Israel. Altogether, not an easy horse to ride.\\n\\nThe best rider is one who is able to keep reminding each part of the coalition that it needs to get along with the other parts.\\n\\nDavid A. Graham: This is really happening\\n\\nJames Poniewozik, the television critic for The New York Times, offered a helpful way to think about Republican and Democratic candidacies in his 2019 book, Audience of One. Trump, Poniewozik argued, was not only an avid consumer of cable-TV programming. Trump himself was a cable-TV program: narrowcast to a small but highly enthusiastic audience. To beat him, Poniewozik suggested, opponents would have to revive the broadcast spirit of old-fashioned network television.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, American households contained large numbers of people and a single TV set. At peak viewing times, the whole family would have to agree on a show. Dad might want an action drama, Mom might want an edgy comedy, one of the kids might want something creative, another might want something scary, but everybody liked nature shows. So thats what the network aired on a Sunday night. Network executives described their task as inventing the least objectionable program. As a candidate for president, Biden may be the least objectionable since Dwight Eisenhower (who won reelection in 1956 despite a near-fatal heart attack the year before).\\n\\nYou want the deal? Heres the deal:\\n\\nMost reelections campaigns are a referendum on the incumbent. Four more years, yes or no? More of the same or something new? The 2024 election is different. Trump insists that everything always be a referendum on him. In 2024, Biden and his party are eager to agree. The anti-Trump coalition is bigger than the pro-Trump coalition: roughly 3 million votes bigger in 2016, 7 million votes bigger in 2020, probably somewhere between those two figures in 2024. The Electoral College was slightly tilted in Trumps direction, but Biden is more appealing than most Democrats in the Trump-favoring swing states of the Midwest.\\n\\nYet Bidens appeal and its limits may be the wrong place to pay attention. This years election is a contest between the constitutional and democratic forces in American society and the anticonstitutional and antidemocratic forces. The candidates are only incidentally the story; the fateful national choice, the deep social forces driving that choicethose are the story. Biden is not really the leader of the constitutional and democratic side of this mighty contest. Biden is the instrument of the constitutional and democratic side.\\n\\nThe Bible tells the story of Gideon, a leader of Israel summoned to defeat the Midianite enemy. Gideon assembled an army of 22,000 men. God told Gideon that his army was too big. Gideon reduced the army to 10,000. Still too big. At last, the number was cut to 300. The Bible explains that if Israel had won with a large force, it would have credited its victory to human hands. With 300 only, Israel understood that the credit was Gods.\\n\\nMaybe the Democratic voters of New Hampshire were expressing a similar idea: Trump is not going to be beaten by some charismatic newcomer, by some artful strategy. Trumps going to be beaten by the revulsion of American voters. The message of New Hampshire? The nominee who is needed most is the one who gets in the way least.',\n",
